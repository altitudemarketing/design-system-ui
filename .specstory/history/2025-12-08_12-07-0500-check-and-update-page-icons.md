# Check and update page icons (2025-12-08 12:07-0500)

_**User (2025-12-08 01:50-0500)**_

Icons used for page or section titles should be unique and representative of the area being referenced. For instance, the two-layer architecture icon is a palette but should be a layer icon. The typograpghy page uses the same "T" icon, but the H1 title should be the "T" and the next scale section should be something like "Aa" or 2 different size letters to represent the "scale". Go through each page and check the icons. Make sure the H1 icon matches what is used in the sidebar menu icon, and any sub section icons are unique and representative of that section.

The user wants me to review and update icons across the design system pages to ensure:
1. H1 page title icons match the sidebar menu icons
2. Sub-section icons are unique and representative of their content
3. Specific examples given:
   - Two-layer architecture icon should be a "layer" icon, not a palette
   - Typography page H1 should use "T" icon
   - Typography "Type Scale" section should use something like "Aa" or different sized letters

Let me first read the relevant files to understand the current icon usage across pages</details></think>
