# Deploy to existing Vercel project (2025-12-08 22:41-0500)

_**User (2025-12-08 03:42-0500)**_

How do I deploy this repo to my vercel account? When I try to import from Github url it tells me a repo already exists with that name. I dont want to make a new repo, just use the one in the account. https://vercel.com/altitude-projects/

The user is trying to deploy their design system repo to Vercel and is running into an issue where Vercel says a repo already exists with that name. They're pointing to https://vercel.com/altitude-projects/ which appears to be a Vercel team/account.

Let me help them understand the situation and provide guidance on how to connect to an existing Vercel project or deploy to their account.

A few things to clarify:
1. The workspace shows this is NOT a git repo currently (`Is directory a git repo: No`)
2. They want to deploy to an existing Vercel account/team called "altitude-projects"
3. They're getting an error about a repo already existing

Let me provide guidance on how to:
1. Connect to an existing Vercel project
2. Or create a new project linked to an existing GitHub repo</details></think>

---

Based on your situation, here's how to handle this:

## The Issue

When Vercel says "a repo already exists with that name," it likely means:
1. There's already a Vercel **project** linked to that GitHub repository in your team/account
2. Or there's a naming conflict

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use the Existing Vercel Project (Recommended)

If a project already exists in your `altitude-projects` team:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/altitude-projects
2. Look for the existing project in your project list
3. Click on it and go to **Settings** → **Git**
4. You can reconnect or reconfigure the GitHub repo connection there

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Local Deploy)

Since your current directory isn't a git repo yet, you can use the Vercel CLI to deploy directly:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/scottfoster/git/design system"

# Login to Vercel (will open browser)
vercel login

# Deploy - this will prompt you to link to existing project or create new
vercel
```

When prompted, you can:
- **Link to existing project** - Select your team `altitude-projects` and choose the existing project
- Or create a new project with a different name

### Option 3: Link to Existing Project Directly

If you know the project name already exists:

```bash
vercel link
```

This will let you connect your local folder to an existing Vercel project without creating a new one.

---

**Quick Question:** Do you see any existing projects when you log into https://vercel.com/altitude-projects? If so, what's the project name? That will help determine if you should link to it or if there's a different issue.

there arent any projects in there...I deleted them trying to fix the issue

The user deleted all projects in their Vercel account trying to fix the issue, but they're still getting the "repo already exists" error when trying to import from GitHub.

This is a common issue - even after deleting a Vercel project, the GitHub repository connection might still exist, or Vercel might still have a record of the repo being used.

Let me help them with the solutions:

1. The issue is likely on the GitHub side - there might be a Vercel GitHub App installation that still has the repo connected
2. They may need to disconnect the repo from Vercel's GitHub integration first
3. Or use a different approach like CLI deployment

Let me provide clear steps to resolve this.</details></think>

---

Ah, that's a common issue! Even after deleting Vercel projects, the **GitHub integration** may still have a record of that repo connection. Here's how to fix it:

## Solution: Disconnect the Repo from Vercel's GitHub App

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Settings

1. Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Applications** → **Installed GitHub Apps**
   - Direct link: https://github.com/settings/installations

2. Find **Vercel** in the list and click **Configure**

3. Under "Repository access," you'll see which repos Vercel has access to. You can:
   - Remove the specific repo and re-add it
   - Or just note that it's there

### Step 2: Clear Vercel's Connection

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/altitude-projects
2. Click on your **team settings** (gear icon or "Settings" in the sidebar)
3. Go to **Git** or **Integrations** → **GitHub**
4. Look for any "connected repositories" and disconnect the problematic one

### Step 3: Try Importing Again

After disconnecting, go back to:
- https://vercel.com/new
- Select your team `altitude-projects`
- Import the GitHub repo fresh

---

## Alternative: Just Use Vercel CLI

If the above is frustrating, the CLI bypasses all of this:

```bash
cd "/Users/scottfoster/git/design system"
npx vercel --yes
```

This will deploy directly and create a new project without needing the GitHub import flow.

---

Would you like me to help you run the CLI deployment, or do you want to try clearing the GitHub connection first?

_**User (2025-12-08 03:42-0500)**_

I dont see any connections in github or vercel. Lets just use the cli. The build failed before because I only imported the UI directory and it said it couldnt resolve the token folder files in the root.

The user wants to use the CLI approach. They also mentioned that their previous build failed because they only imported the UI directory and it couldn't resolve the token folder files in the root.

Let me look at the project structure to understand the setup better. From the project layout:
- `/tokens/` - contains JSON files for design tokens
- `/ui/` - contains the UI components (82 files)

The UI directory likely imports from the tokens directory. Let me check the project structure and understand how the imports work, then help them deploy the whole repo correctly.

Let me first check if there's a package.json in the ui folder and understand the project structure better.</details></think>

---

That makes sense! The `ui/` folder likely imports from the `tokens/` folder at the root. Let me check the project structure to help you deploy correctly.

I found it. The `ui/src/lib/tokens/parser.ts` file imports from `../../../../tokens/` which goes up to the root and then into the tokens folder. This is why deploying only the `ui/` directory failed - it can't find the tokens directory.

For Vercel deployment, we need to deploy from the root of the repo, not the ui subdirectory. We can use a `vercel.json` to configure the root directory for the build, or better yet, tell Vercel CLI to use the full repo but specify the build directory.

Let me create a vercel.json at the root that tells Vercel to build from the ui directory but include the whole repo.</details></think>

Found it! The file `ui/src/lib/tokens/parser.ts` imports from `../../../../tokens/` (the root `tokens/` folder). This is why deploying only `ui/` failed.

Hmm, the build started but it's looking for Next.js in the root, not the ui folder. The vercel.json isn't being picked up correctly. Let me modify the approach - we need to specify the root directory setting for Vercel.

Actually, looking at this more closely, Vercel is trying to find Next.js at the root level, not in the ui folder. The vercel.json approach might not work as expected because Vercel is looking for the framework detection before running custom commands.

Let me try a different approach - use the `rootDirectory` setting in vercel.json instead.</details></think>

The build is failing because Vercel is looking for Next.js at the root. Let me fix the `vercel.json` to use the proper `rootDirectory` setting:

Actually, the problem is that Vercel needs the whole repo for the imports to work, but the Next.js app is in the ui folder. The solution is to either:

1. Move the imports to be within the ui folder 
2. Or configure Vercel to look at the whole repo but build from ui

Let me try a different approach - configure the project settings directly through the CLI. But first, let me check if there's a simpler solution - maybe we need to adjust the tsconfig to support the path structure better.

Actually, the cleanest solution for Vercel when you have a monorepo-like structure is to:
1. Keep vercel.json minimal
2. Configure the project via the Vercel dashboard or via the .vercel/project.json settings

But since the build already failed, let me try to redeploy with the correct settings. The issue is that Vercel detects Next.js but can't find it at the root.

Let me try using the vercel CLI with specifying the project directory more explicitly, or we need to restructure the vercel.json to properly tell Vercel about the mono-repo structure.

Actually, looking at the Vercel docs, for this kind of setup, we should use `"rootDirectory": "ui"` in the vercel.json, BUT that would break the token imports since they go up 4 levels to the root tokens folder.

The real solution here is to not use relative path imports that go outside the ui folder. Instead, we should:
1. Copy the tokens to the ui folder during build
2. Or use a workspace/monorepo setup with npm/pnpm workspaces
3. Or create a simple copy script

Let me create a build script approach - copy tokens into ui during the build.</details></think>

---

The issue is that Vercel's `rootDirectory` would break the token imports. Let me create a proper setup that copies the tokens into the ui folder during build:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I need to update the imports in the parser.ts to look for the tokens in a local folder instead of going up 4 levels. Let me create a solution that works both locally and on Vercel.

Actually, let me think about this differently. The parser.ts imports from `../../../../tokens/`. In the ui folder, that goes:
- ui/src/lib/tokens/parser.ts 
- ../../../../ goes up to the root "design system" folder
- then into tokens/

If we copy tokens to ui/tokens-data, we need to update the import to be `../../../tokens-data/` or we could use a different approach.

A better approach might be to:
1. Keep the original structure for local dev
2. Update the vercel.json to copy tokens where they're expected

Actually, let me check if symlinks would work, or just update the paths with conditional logic. But the simplest solution is to make the paths work for both environments.

Let me think... On Vercel, the files are at `/vercel/path0/` so the relative paths should still work if we're deploying the whole repo. The issue is Vercel can't find Next.js at the root.

Let me try a different approach - create a minimal package.json at the root that points to the ui folder.</details></think>

Actually, let me try a cleaner approach. The relative imports should work if Vercel builds from the whole repo. The issue is Vercel not finding Next.js. Let me create a root package.json that delegates to ui:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The issue is Vercel is still detecting this as a Next.js project but can't find the "next" dependency in the root package.json. Vercel detects Next.js before running the custom build command.

Options:
1. Add "next" as a dependency in the root package.json 
2. Don't specify framework: nextjs and let the build command handle everything
3. Use a different approach

Let me try option 2 - remove the framework setting and let it be a generic build.</details></think>

Vercel is detecting Next.js but can't find it in the root. Let me remove the framework setting so it just runs our custom build:

But wait, even without the framework setting, Vercel might still auto-detect Next.js. Let me also check if there's a .vercel folder that has cached settings from the previous attempt.</details></think>
